## Blocks and Block Header

All transactions on the Bitcoin protocol are grouped into blocks (Each block is a collection of transactions) on an approximately 10 minute interval. The block is then broadcasted to the network. Considering the volume of transactions in a block (~ 10 mins), Bitcoin doesn't actually transmit a full record of all transactions in a block, but rather include the Merkle root of that block's transactions in its header ("block header"). Full nodes participants can however obtain the full transactions in a block by sending a separate request.

Because the [Merkle root is a cryptographic accumulator](../cryptography-in-blockchain) over all transactions in a block, 
it is possible for any node to verify the integrity of a block -- or inclusion of a transaction -- by verifying the Merkle root. 

Let's now take a deeper look at what makes up a "block chain" in the original Bitcoin protocol as conceptualized by Satoshi Nakamoto.
