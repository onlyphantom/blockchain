## Encryption and Bitcoin
The reference of the Bitcoin source code provides implementations of 
both a node and a wallet. The wallet is responsible for generating and storing
public and private keys, through which the node can encrypt and decrypt messages, 
allowing the user to send and receive bitcoins.

Its implementation of the wallet uses [AES-256](../cryptography#aes) and is 
called `crypto/aes`. Independent developers can use the reference implementation to 
create wallets in the form of mobile apps, web wallets, or even hardware wallets.

Encryption however isn't part of the Bitcoin protocol as its akin to a public, distributed ledger and data flows within the network unencrypted. 
Blockchain, however, uses hash functions to ensure that the data is not tampered with ("signature"), an
idea that we will explore in much greater depth in the following sections.
