Bitcoin and the blockchain technology ushered in a new era and "developed the foundation for a new digital theory of property rights" (Nakamoto.com),
but if your introduction to the field is through YouTube videos and social media, you may find that the education on this topic is seriously lacking compared
to the speculation of the crypto-currency market. 

I've created Learn Blockchain Academy to help you navigate the engineering -- and sometimes philosophical -- principles of the blockchain. This is not an exhaustive, academically rigorous course,
but it is sufficiently rich in theory, highly practical, accessible and illustrative to anyone who is interested to learn about the inner working of the blockchain.

It is our belief that an education-first approach to cryptography will be the best way to acquire an appreciation for the underlying principles of blockchain, and thus increase the 
adoption of blockchain technology.

### Update 2022-01-09
Still under development. Follow [Samuel on Github](https://github.com/onlyphantom) to stay updated on the progress,

LearnBlockchain is developed as an interactive workbook. You will learn while interacting
with live examples, interactive elements, quizzes and live code "sandbox":

<Button type="primary">Primary Button</Button>
    <Button>Default Button</Button>
    <Button type="dashed">Dashed Button</Button>
<Alert message="Success Text" type="success" />

An example of interactive code:
```javascript react-live=true
const elem = <button style={{color: 'seagreen'}}>
                Change me to blue.
             </button>
render(elem)
```

```javascript
- const data = ['1','2'];
+ const data = [1,2];
```

```javascript react-live=true hide-code
const App = () => {

    const [val, setVal] = React.useState(1704)

    return (
        <div>
            <h1>Hashing</h1>

            <p>
                {val} Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet consectetur adipisicing elit. Commodi voluptas tenetur dignissimos 
                <br/> Aspernatur, corrupti repellat debitis officia, odit doloribus consequatur unde amet similique ipsum laborum eveniet, maxime saepe. Inventore aliquam consequatur perferendis iste veritatis mollitia veniam odit.
            </p>
        </div>
    )
}
render(App)
```
